SQL Performance Tuning
Pre-Class Read
Introduction
SQL Performance Tuning refers to the techniques used to optimize query execution, improve
database response times, and ensure efficient data retrieval. If your database is slow, it can affect the
performance of applications relying on it. Just like organizing files in a cabinet helps you find them
faster, SQL tuning ensures that queries run efficiently.
Why is SQL Performance Tuning Important?
Faster Query Execution: Optimized queries return results quickly.
Efficient Resource Usage: Reduces CPU, memory, and disk usage.
